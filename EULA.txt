**1. MVP Scope and Limitations:**
   The Software is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind. Its features are limited to those described in the project documentation (e.g., README.md, specification document).

**2. Grant of License (for Monitoring Minor Children):**
   The Software is intended solely for the purpose of monitoring computer activity of minor children for whom you are the parent or legal guardian.
   By using this Software, you represent and warrant that:
   a. You are the parent or legal guardian of any minor child whose computer activity you intend to monitor using this Software.
   b. You will use this Software in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations regarding the monitoring of minors and computer usage.
   c. You acknowledge that unauthorized monitoring of individuals may violate privacy laws and other legal statutes.

**3. Consent Mechanism (MVP):**
   To activate the monitoring functionalities of this Software, you must explicitly set the `eula_accepted` flag to `true` in the `config.yaml` file. This action signifies your understanding and acceptance of the terms outlined in this EULA, including your confirmation that you are monitoring your own minor child.

**4. Data Storage and Security (MVP):**

**5. Restrictions:**
   You may not:

**7. Limitation of Liability:**
   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPERS OF THE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE DEVELOPERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**8. Governing Law:**
   This EULA shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the software developer resides, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

**By setting `eula_accepted: true` in `config.yaml`, you acknowledge that you have read this EULA, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.**

If you have any questions concerning this EULA, or if you desire to contact the developers for any reason, please refer to the project documentation for contact information (if available).
