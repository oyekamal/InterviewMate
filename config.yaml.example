# Parental Monitor Configuration File Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and modify as needed.
# The application will look for config.yaml in the following order:
# 1. Current working directory.
# 2. Directory of the main application script/executable.
# 3. System-specific installation directory:
#    - Windows: %ProgramFiles%/ParentalMonitor/config.yaml
#    - Linux: /opt/parental-monitor/config.yaml

# Interval in minutes for taking screenshots
screenshot_interval_minutes: 5

# Directory where daily logs and screenshots will be stored.
# Can be an absolute path (e.g., C:/Users/YourUser/ParentalMonitorData or /home/youruser/ParentalMonitorData)
# Or a relative path (e.g., MyLogs). If relative, it's usually relative to:
#   - the directory containing config.yaml if config_file_path is known by the logger,
#   - or the current working directory of the application if config_file_path is not available.
# It's generally recommended to use an absolute path for services.
log_directory: "ParentalMonitorData" # Default: creates ParentalMonitorData in app's relative context

# Path to the file that will store the AES encryption key.
# IMPORTANT: Protect this key file. If lost, data cannot be decrypted.
# If relative, path is resolved similarly to log_directory (often relative to config.yaml's location).
# It is recommended to keep this key file OUTSIDE the log_directory.
encryption_key_file: "encryption.key" # Default: creates encryption.key near config or app

# Filters for keyword logging
keyword_filters:
  # List of process names (without .exe) to monitor.
  # If empty or not specified, all processes where typing is detected might be logged (platform permitting).
  # Example: ["chrome", "firefox", "slack", "notepad", "wordpad", "msedge", "brave"]
  include_processes:
    - "chrome"
    - "firefox"
    - "msedge" # Microsoft Edge
    - "brave"
    - "opera"
    - "safari" # If applicable on the OS
    - "slack"
    - "discord"
    - "notepad"
    # Add more browser names, chat applications, document editors etc.
    # For Linux, process names are usually lowercase, e.g., "gedit", "gnome-terminal"

  # List of words to exclude from logging (case-insensitive).
  # Useful for preventing logging of passwords or sensitive phrases.
  exclude_words:
    - "password"
    - "secret"
    - "pswd"
    - "mysecretkey"
    # Add any other words or phrases you want to explicitly ignore.

# EULA acceptance status.
# For the MVP, this might be manually set to true by the parent after reading terms.
# In a more complete version, the application's first run would prompt for this.
# Setting this to `true` implies consent to monitoring according to terms.
eula_accepted: false # Change to true to enable monitoring after reviewing terms.

# --- Advanced / Future Settings (Not all may be used in MVP) ---
# Minimum length for a word to be logged (e.g., ignore "a", "to")
# min_word_length: 3

# Timeout in seconds to flush buffered keystrokes if no new key is pressed.
# This helps capture words even if the user pauses typing without a delimiter.
# keystroke_buffer_timeout: 5

# Disk space management (example, not implemented in current MVP logger)
# stop_logging_if_disk_space_less_than_gb: 5
# delete_logs_older_than_days: 30
